# Projects

These projects are meant to take at least a few hours, possibly spread out over multiple days.

### Thimble
[Mozilla's Thimble](https://thimble.mozilla.org/en-US/) is a godsend for teaching the basics of HTML + CSS. The main feature of the platform is an in-browser code editor with live preview - I can't image a way to get started coding with less friction. To top it all of there are a bunch of projects ready to go that a beginner can easily extend. My personal favourite is the [HTML Burger](https://thimbleprojects.org/mozillalearning/286539/).

### Painting with Divs
While [Google Coder](https://googlecreativelab.github.io/coder/) was not something I included in my bootcamp, some of their starter projects can be easily adapted for a generic HTML/CSS workshop. In particular I adapted a project called [Make Your Own Mondrain](https://googlecreativelab.github.io/coder-projects/projects/mondrian/). I liked this one so much because it takes a normally dry subject like divs and transforms it into an opportunity to make art. I've included [a simplified version](modern_mondrian).

### The Aquarium

This one is great because it's possible for kids to do it from scratch!

The prerequisites are:
  * The kids know what a div is and how to make one
  * They can add styles to elements (border, color, etc)
  * They can add images

For anyone who finds this too easy:

  * Try making a fish with pure HTML and CSS. Trying adding a [cool pattern](http://lea.verou.me/css3patterns/) with pure HTML and CSS
  * Try incorporating Javascript code to make their fish move from side to side
  * Try using the `z-index` property to arrange different fish, castles, and seaweeds
