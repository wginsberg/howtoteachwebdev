# Question of the Week

This is always one of my best memories from my coding bootcamp.

Each week I'd write a question on the board at the front of the room. Each kid would get a sticky note and a pen so they could write their response, and stick it up on the board. The responses I got were sometimes hilarious, and sometimes they surprised me with how much they knew. But _every single time_ the kids were interested in learning the correct answer*.

_*The winner always got a prize, so even if there is no right answer..._

I'd recommend something completely open ended the first time around:

   * "If I could code anything at all it would be ..."
   * "My favourite website to visit is ____ and that's because ___"

Before moving onto something more exciting:

   * "What does a website know about you the first time you visit it?" [Demonstration](https://clickclickclick.click/)
   * Show them a picture of the [undersea cable map](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/) and ask "What is it?" An awesome follow up is to show [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve810FHZ1CQ)
   * Show them a picture of a [data center](https://simplecore.intel.com/itpeernetwork/wp-content/uploads/sites/38/2015/01/DC01.jpg) and ask "What is it?" Awesome follow up [video](https://youtu.be/7d2JyaW9X34?t=2m53s)

More straight forward questions are good too (only after you've built some trust first that this _is_ going to be fun)
* "What web browser is used by the most internet users?"
* "Name two things inside any computer" Show this video after: [Inside your computer - Bettina Bair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkFi90lZmXA)
* "What is an important difference between Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Firefox, or Safari?"
