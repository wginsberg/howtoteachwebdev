# How To Teach Webdev*
Materials and wisdom from running a coding bootcamp

_* to kids_

## What is this?

In the summer of 2017 I taught a HTML+CSS coding bootcamp for kids at a public library. In this repository you'll find a collection of materials I used, interspersed with some thoughts about how teach webdev in a fun and effective way.

## How is this repository organized?

I divided up my materials into the following sections:

#### Energizers
Also known as ice-breakers, these are not necessarily related to the curriculum, but should be included in most sessions.

#### Warm ups / Exercises
Structured activities that focus on re-enforcing on one or two key concepts.

#### Projects
Get the kids "hacking" at a big problem and allow them to run freely.

#### Question of the week
A trivia game about random topics in web development or coding in general.
